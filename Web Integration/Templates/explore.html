        <h2>About Electric Vehicles</h2>
<p>
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing the global automotive industry by replacing traditional internal combustion engines with advanced electric powertrains. Instead of petrol or diesel, EVs operate using rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs that power electric motors. This transition significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, and promotes sustainable mobility.
</p>

<p>
Modern EVs are equipped with regenerative braking systems, smart battery management technology, and connected dashboards that provide real-time performance insights. With lower operational costs and minimal maintenance requirements, electric vehicles are becoming a cost-effective alternative to conventional fuel-powered cars.
</p>

<h2>Why Electric Vehicles Matter</h2>
<ul>
    Reduction in Carbon Emissions and Air Pollution,
    Energy Independence & Reduced Oil Imports,
    Lower Running and Maintenance Costs,
    Technological Innovation in Battery & Charging Systems,
    Support for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
</ul>

<h2>Global EV Market Growth</h2>
<p>
Globally, electric vehicle adoption has accelerated rapidly over the past decade. Countries like China, the United States, and several European nations have led the transition through strong policy frameworks, charging infrastructure development, and financial incentives. Major automotive manufacturers are shifting toward fully electric production strategies, signaling a long-term transformation of the mobility ecosystem.
</p>

<h2>Growth of EVs in India</h2>
<p>
India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing EV markets. Government initiatives such as the FAME scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) have played a key role in boosting EV adoption. The expansion of charging infrastructure, increasing consumer awareness, and the launch of affordable EV models have significantly improved market penetration.
</p>

<p>
The growth is especially strong in electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, while electric passenger cars are steadily gaining traction in metropolitan and Tier-2 cities. With rising fuel prices and environmental concerns, India is steadily progressing toward a cleaner transportation ecosystem.
</p>

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>
This project analyzes and visualizes electric vehicle trends across India and global markets. Through interactive dashboards and data-driven storytelling, the objective is to understand adoption patterns, brand performance, regional penetration, and overall EV ecosystem growth.
</p>

<p>
By exploring the dashboard and story sections, users can gain insights into real-world EV data, helping them understand the transformation of the automotive industry toward electrification.
